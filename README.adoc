== LKM-Hacking

* Dependencies :
** linux-headers-generic

* Introduction :

*LKMs are Loadable Kernel Modules used by the Linux kernel to expand his functionality*. The advantage of those LKMs : The can be loaded dynamically; there must be no recompilation of the whole kernel. Because of those features they are often used for specific device drivers (or filesystems) such as soundcards etc.
Every LKM consist of two basic functions (*minimum*) :

```
static int __init module_init(void){

    return 0;
}


static void __exit module_exit(void){

}
```
